#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customers, employees, invoice data.


#1 Show only the customers in Canada.

SELECT customerid, firtname, lastname
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Canada";


#2 Show all customers who are not in Canada

SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country <> "Canada";


#3 What employees are managers?

SELECT firstname, lastname, title
FROM Chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%manager%';


#4 Who is the youngest employee?

SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM Chinook.employees
ORDER BY birthdate desc
LIMIT 1;


#5 How many invoice orders were made in 2013?

SELECT count(*)
FROM Chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';


#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


#6 Which employees managed invoices for customers in North America and what for what customers?

SELECT distinct e.firstname, e.lastname, c.customerid
FROM Chinook.employees e
LEFT JOIN Chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportRepid
WHERE c.country = 'USA'
ORDER BY e.firstname;


#7 What customer had the largest order for 2013?

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, ROUND(sum(items.unitprice*items.quantity),2) AS 'Order_Cost'
FROM Chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN Chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid=i.customerid
JOIN Chinook.invoice_items items
ON items.invoicelineid=i.invoiceid
WHERE i.invoicedate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31'
ORDER BY Order_Cost;
